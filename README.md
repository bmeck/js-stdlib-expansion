# JS Standard Library Expansion Effort

This repository contains a collection of efforts to expand the standard library of JS.
The intent of expanding the standard library is to provide a more uniform experience for common uses of JS without relying on custom implementations.

## Directory Structure

* `/proposals` - contains all the proposals under directories grouping the topics they apply to.

* `/templates` - template files to help get started when working on proposals.

These templates each contain a `README.md` file containing instructions on how to work towards a specific stage.

## Contributing

See the [Contributing](./.github/CONTRIBUTING.md) document.

## Mentoring

One of the goals of this effort is to introduce a way for new or inexperienced members of TC39 to gain experience by working with other members willing to share the burden of a proposal by acting as a mentor.

Mentors will be expected to be available for mentees as time permits for all involved parties.

It is the responsibility of the mentor to keep a well defined focus for a proposal by providing actionable items that could assist in moving a proposal forward. For example, upon finding an API design that uses brand checking the mentor may mention:

 * that brand checking has been controversial in the past
 * other API designs that do not use brand checking
 * gather relevant parties that have been discussing the topic of brand checking in the past to preview the API and talk with the mentee

Mentors are generally sought at the time of seeking Stage 1 for a proposal with assistance from other effort members.
