# JS Standard Library Expansion Effort

This repository contains a collection of efforts to expand the standard library of JS.
The intent of expanding the standard library is to provide a more uniform experience for common uses of JS without relying on custom implementations.

## Directory Structure

* `/proposals` - contains all the proposals under directories grouping the topics they apply to.

* `/templates` - template files to help get started when working on proposals.

These templates each contain a `README.md` file containing instructions on how to work towards a specific stage.
