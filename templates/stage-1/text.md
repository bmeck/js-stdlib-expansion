# FEATURE NAME

## Champion(s)

Put your name and handle here.

If you are not a member of TC39, include the TC39 member who will be representing your proposal to committee.

## Use Case

Provide a brief description of the intended usage of this API.

It should list all of the API surface to be added to JS.

## Example

Provide a brief example using the API in a few concrete scenarios.
These scenarios should be able to be mapped to some common usage in the wild. It is preferrable if the example maps to some of the data gathering done below.

## Example Desugared

Provide comparable use with current standard library if relevant.
This example should explain common problems with using the existing APIs and/or potential edge cases that can be missed when implementing the API with existing JS functionality.

## Data on Other Languages and Existing JS Libraries

1. Compare naming

Provide a list of common names to provide this functionality.

If the naming is diverse across environments, provide a reasoning for the choice in final naming.

2. Compare API design

Provide a very small explanation of *differences* between environments in API design. Explain the choices that went into the final API design.

* Function overloading
* Function arguments
* Function return values

If APIs are similar across environments, state this fact.

### Metrics (if available)

Be sure to record relevant data metrics when forming the comparisons above.

Examples:

* `npm` downloads.
* Website usage.
* Github Code Search
* Stack overflow issues
  * Common problems with APIs
  * Searchability of solutions
