# Stage 0

[See the requirements from the Process Document](https://tc39.github.io/process-document/)

Find the relevant area of work within `/proposals` to place your proposal or create a new one.

Fill out the `text.md` template file and place it in your proposal's directory as `stage-0.md`.

For example, after filling out the `text.md` for a proposal which affects all Collections, make a directory `/proposals/collections/configurable-hash`. Place the file in `/proposals/collections/configurable-hash/stage-0.md`.

At this point, the effort manager will seek to find a relevant TC39 member if you are not one to work with and bring the proposal to the committee for Stage 1.

Once a TC39 member has been found, your proposal will be merged and the champion(s) should begin on Stage 1.
